I had been wanting to get back to the interview format for a while, and I got the chance to do it at the MVP Summit in Redmond. It felt like a good moment to touch on current topics like artificial intelligence, security, programming, data storage, and cloud computing.

In this episode we go for a walk with Quique Dutra to talk about a fundamental topic in tech usage: today we constantly live alongside fraud attempts and scams, and it will get more dangerous because technology moves faster than our minds. If you want a clear conversation about the current state of cybersecurity, this episode is for you. Let me know in the comments if you know of any interesting case to share.
