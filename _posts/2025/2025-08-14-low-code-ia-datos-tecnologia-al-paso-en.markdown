We’re back with a lively episode: we walk and talk with the Power Mates about low code, AI, and the current state of data. It’s a dynamic conversation that blends real‑world experience with a very honest look at the impact all of this is having on companies and teams.

If you’re interested in trends and how to land them in real projects, this episode is full of good hints.
