t's incredible to see everything that’s happened recently with artificial intelligence. Until now, the only way to interact with these impressive algorithms — capable of performing complex tasks in seconds — was through platforms like mini DALL·E or ChatGPT.

But now, is it possible to access these capabilities as a cloud service? The answer is yes — Azure has announced that these functionalities are now part of its services.

What can we do with it? Generate images, chat with an advanced learning model, and even create code. And it doesn’t stop there — this can be combined with other Azure services, such as Cognitive Services. Imagine talking to ChatGPT using a neural voice!

While we’re still at the beginning of this journey, we might already start seeing these algorithms integrated into real-world applications — possibly by the end of the year.

Would you use it in your app?
