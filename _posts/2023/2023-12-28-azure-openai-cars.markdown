One of the most common topics when discussing artificial intelligence is autonomous driving — but that’s not the only way Azure can help improve the automotive experience. Here are some real-life examples of how Azure services have been integrated into the industry:

## ChatGPT in Mercedes Benz

The German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz set out to enhance its voice assistant ("Hey Mercedes") by integrating ChatGPT through Azure OpenAI. The result? A smarter, more natural assistant that not only understands fluid and conversational questions, but also maintains context-aware conversations. For example, you can ask where the nearest gas station is, and then follow up by asking if there’s a place to eat nearby — and it will understand the context.

## Cruise and General Motors

Microsoft and General Motors announced a partnership to accelerate the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Cruise, GM’s self-driving division, will use Azure to speed up development and deployment. Azure becomes the preferred cloud provider for both Cruise and GM. Additionally, GM will adopt Microsoft 365 and Teams for internal operations.

## Volskwagen

To build on the partnership established in 2018 between Microsoft and Volkswagen, a cloud-based platform has been developed to support autonomous driving software. Volkswagen’s software arm, Car.Software, is using Azure to accelerate development and meet its goals more efficiently.

## CarMax

This case isn’t about manufacturing cars, but about improving the buying and selling experience. CarMax — one of the largest used car dealership chains in the U.S. — integrated Azure OpenAI to enhance the customer experience. For instance, AI was used to generate descriptions for over 5,000 vehicles, dramatically reducing content creation time. Manually, the same task would have taken over 11 years to complete.

Can you think of other ways Azure could be used in the automotive industry?
