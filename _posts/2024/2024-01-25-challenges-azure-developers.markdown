This year started off a bit more relaxed than usual for me, so I took the opportunity to finish up some courses I had pending. That’s why I’ve picked 5 free Azure challenges that I think are great for software developers in general:

* [Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/challenges?id=8E1F62A7-99E3-48E4-9EC9-1FFFB99EE9AF&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003354): This course shows you the most basic examples of how to leverage artificial intelligence to improve your applications. No advanced programming skills required.

* [Azure Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/challenges?id=4B2F91E9-04C5-4A1C-8F67-443ADEFD0806&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003354): If you want a broader look at how to build cloud applications as a developer — no matter your development background — this course is a great place to start.

* [Java on Azure Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/challenges?id=169a2977-dccc-4e6c-9990-1dde71b456b8&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003354): Not using C# but specialize in Java? No problem. This course walks you through how to build cloud apps using your favorite language.

* [Azure Cosmos DB Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/challenges?id=d6c6d844-1da1-470f-9157-ee9471c6b55d&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003354): Beyond code, understanding how to get the most out of data storage is crucial. This challenge focuses on how to use Cosmos DB effectively as a non-relational database.

* [New Year C# Certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/challenges?id=76615901-392C-413E-B7A2-0A015F52F44E&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003354): Whether you're new to C# or experienced and looking to refresh your knowledge, this New Year challenge is perfect for revisiting the core concepts needed to build apps with C#. Even though it officially ends in February, you can still complete the modules at your own pace.

Do you have other challenges you'd recommend?
