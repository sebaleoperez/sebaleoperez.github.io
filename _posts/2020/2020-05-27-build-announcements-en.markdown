Another Microsoft Build has come and gone, bringing lots of news, but what really stood out about this edition is that it was **100% online and free**. First of all, if you want to learn more about what Microsoft Build is, you can listen to the [Pinta-NET podcast](https://bit.ly/pinta-net-1)

where we talk about the history of the event and some interesting facts.

**MAUI:** The successor to Xamarin Forms was announced, but unfortunately we’ll have to wait until 2021 to start using it.

**WINUI + Project Reunion:** Great news for Windows development — both UWP and Win32 will be unified under the name WinUI 3.0.

**Blazor WebAssembly:** .NET is now available across the entire web development stack (frontend and backend).

**Github Codespaces:** We’ll be able to use the IDE directly from GitHub repositories.

**Supercomputers:** Microsoft is making strong moves in the supercomputing space with Azure, supported by a partnership with OpenAI.

**C#9:** A new version of the most widely used language in .NET.

**Surface Duo:** New features related to development on this innovative device.

In conclusion, I found the online event experience interesting, although having it on a regular workday was a bit exhausting. That’s one of the things we’ll miss until the in-person format returns. The broadcast worked very well and allowed for pausing and resuming, which I found very convenient for following the content without missing anything.

From a tech perspective, I see a solid future for .NET, although I believe the journey will be long and challenging. And I have no doubt the path will increasingly lead toward **Artificial Intelligence and supercomputing**.

If you want a more detailed breakdown of the announcements from each day, here are the posts we made with **Xablu**:
